# Reposite

Self-hosted backup manager for WordPress websites. Downloads files via FTP/SFTP, dumps the database, and pushes everything to a GitHub repository. Web UI to manage sites, run backups, follow logs and schedule everything.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the secrets
npm run db:migrate     # create / update the database

# Dev
npm run dev

# Production
npm run build
npm run start

# Checks
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

First start opens a setup page to create the admin account (email + password, 12 characters minimum), then lands on Settings: fill in the GitHub commit author and token first, the sites come next. The password can be changed from the Account section of Settings. Lost password:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/reset-password.ts admin@example.com   # prints a generated password
```

## Config

Environment variables, see [.env.example](./.env.example):

- `DATA_DIR` — database, site clones and certificates
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — encrypts stored passwords and tokens
- `SESSION_SECRET` — signs the session cookie
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` — `false` to allow the session cookie over plain HTTP (production marks it Secure by default)
- `TZ` — timezone for cron schedules

### GitHub

Fine-grained personal access token restricted to the backup repos, with `Contents: read/write` and `Metadata: read`. Stored encrypted, used for pushes and releases. The "Test token" button in Settings checks the token against GitHub and the push access to every site's repository; the commit author name and email are configured next to it.

> Backup repos must be **private**: they contain `wp-config.php` and the full database dump.

### SharePoint List update

The app can update a date field in a SharePoint list after each backup.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com, App Registrations, "New Registration"
2. Under "API Permissions" add the application permission SharePoint/Sites.ReadWrite.All
3. Generate a certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout keytmp.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -passout pass:HereIsMySuperPass -subj '/CN=reposite'
openssl rsa -in keytmp.pem -out key.pem -passin pass:HereIsMySuperPass
```
4. Upload `cert.pem` to the App Registration under "Certificates & secrets" and copy the thumbprint
5. Put `key.pem` in `$DATA_DIR/sp-certificates/`
6. Fill in the SharePoint section in Settings, then set the list item ID on each site

> Certificates expire and you will have to regenerate it every year!!

## How it works

The app runs the following steps for each site:

1. **Git clone or fetch** the backup repo and reset it on the remote default branch
2. **Cleanup leftover artifacts** — removes old SQL dumps, tokens and PHP scripts left by previous runs on the remote server
3. **Token authentication** — generates a unique token, uploads its hash via FTP/SFTP
4. **Database dump** — uploads `backup-wp.php` to the site, triggers it via HTTPS with the token in a header. The PHP script self-deletes after execution
5. **Dump download & validation** — downloads the SQL file right away to `db.sql` at the root of the repo, verifies it is not empty and contains valid SQL, deletes it from the remote server
6. **Incremental download** — scans remote files and only downloads those that changed (different size or modification date). FTP uses a pool of 5 parallel connections, SFTP 3
7. **Git commit, tag & push** — one commit per run with a UTC tag (`YYYYMMDD-HHmmss`); nothing is committed when nothing changed
8. **GitHub release** — one release per backup on the tag, with the run stats
9. **SharePoint update** — updates the last backup date in the SharePoint list (optional)

## Security

- The web UI and API are behind a login: one admin account created at first run, session in a signed `httpOnly` cookie (7 days), no default credentials
- Login attempts are throttled per address (5 failures, 15 minutes lockout)
- Passwords and tokens are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- The PHP script (`backup-wp.php`) is protected by a unique token generated per run, only its hash is stored on the server
- The token is deleted from the server as soon as it's validated
- The PHP script self-deletes after execution
- The dump filename is unguessable and the dump is deleted from the server right after download
- MySQL password is passed through the environment, never on the command line
- Git commands run without a shell, the GitHub token is handed to git through the environment and never appears in URLs, in `.git/config` or in logs
- A safeguard automatically cleans up orphaned artifacts at the start of each run

## Incremental vs full mode

By default, backups run in **incremental** mode:
- Compares size and modification date of each remote file with the local file
- Only downloads new or modified files
- Deletes local files that no longer exist on the remote (skipped if part of the remote listing failed)
- FTP scanning uses a pool of 5 parallel connections for faster listing

The "Full download" option clears the local tree and downloads every file again. It refuses to run when part of the remote listing failed, so a partial snapshot never replaces a complete one.

## Multi-site support

Backups run through a queue with limited concurrency (configurable in Settings). Each site has its own log, stored with the run and streamed live in the UI. A site can't have two backups running at the same time. The History page filters by site and status; the site form has a "Test connection" button that lists the web root before saving.

Every enabled site is scheduled with node-cron, on its own cron expression or the global default (the 1st and the 15th at 02:00 by default), in the `TZ` timezone. Old runs are pruned daily once past the retention period; the last 5 of each site are always kept.

## Error handling

- A backup never crashes the app — every run ends with a status (`success`, `error`, `cancelled`) and its log
- SharePoint and release errors are non-blocking (backup is still considered successful)
- Git errors are reported, the backup is marked as error
- On dump failure, remote files (PHP, token) are cleaned up
- Runs interrupted by a restart are marked as error at next boot

## Debug

If something goes wrong with a site, delete `$DATA_DIR/files/your-site` and re-run the backup. It will clone the repo and do a full download.

To look at what the sync would do without touching the remote or the clone:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/smoke-sync.ts your-site.com   # scan + plan, read-only
```

## Deploy (Docker)

The image is built by GitHub Actions and published on GHCR as `ghcr.io/dewwwe-site-saves/reposite`: `staging` on every push to `main`, `latest` and `X.Y.Z` on version tags, `<branch>` when the workflow is run by hand. It runs as a Portainer stack from [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml): Stacks, Add stack, Repository, compose path `docker-compose.yml`, branch `main`. The stack's environment variables carry everything host-specific:

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET` — `openssl rand -hex 32` each
- `REPOSITE_DATA` — host directory mounted on `/data`
- `REPOSITE_SUBNET` — a free `/29` for the stack network
- `REPOSITE_PORT` — host port (default `3000`), `PUID` / `PGID` (default `1000`), `TZ`, `REPOSITE_TAG` (default `latest`)

The container runs as `PUID:PGID`: the entrypoint makes the data directory theirs, applies the migrations and starts the server. Health is reported on `/api/health`. Updates are manual: Stack, Editor, Pull and redeploy. Put the app behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (an SSO gateway in front of it works, the app keeps its own login).

First run: open the app, create the admin on `/setup`, fill in Settings (commit author, GitHub token, SharePoint). To import the sites of a legacy `config.json`, copy it into the data volume, run the import in the container as the app user, then delete it (it holds cleartext passwords):

```bash
docker cp config.json Reposite-App:/data/config.json
docker exec -u 1000 Reposite-App npx tsx scripts/import-config.ts /data/config.json
docker exec Reposite-App rm /data/config.json
```

Lost password in Docker:

```bash
docker exec -u 1000 Reposite-App npx tsx scripts/reset-password.ts admin@example.com
```

Existing clones can be moved into `/data/files/<repo>` while the container is stopped: the entrypoint fixes their ownership at the next boot and the engine resets their remote URL at the next run.

Local build, to check the image before pushing:

```bash
docker build -t reposite:local .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v "$(mktemp -d):/data" -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) -e SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) -e SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false reposite:local
```

## Versioning & Releases

Versions are git tags. Pushing an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag makes GitHub Actions build the image with that version, tag it `latest`, and create a GitHub Release whose notes list the commits since the previous tag. A tag with a suffix (`v2.1.0-beta.1`) is a pre-release.

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

## Roadmap

What comes next, and the checks still pending on the production instance, live in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).
